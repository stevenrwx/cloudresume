Goals: to learn Terraform as a DSL for the aws platform

The biggest parts of Terraform are:

    Resources - a configuration definition for an external entity. For example, aws_vpc, or aws_s3_bucket map to AWS VPCs and Amazon S3 Buckets, respectively.
    Data - similar to a resource, but only exposes the attributes of an existing entity read-only. This is very useful for things created automatically by AWS that you might not have a resource for, but need information about.
    Modules - a “module” is basically just a folder that contains Terraform. Terraform will include all *.tf files in a directory, and make those available as a “module” with the same name as the directory. By default the directory you are running the terraform command inside of is called the “root module”.
    Providers - a “provider” is just what it sounds like. For the purposes of this guide, we will only be using the aws provider, but Terraform supports many more, providing wonderous multi-cloud possibilities.
